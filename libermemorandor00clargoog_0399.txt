hida: a hide, oi land. In the later single-Saron times and in Domesday
rhe term Helle signihed the unit in which men reckoned land, when assessing
ir ior the land tax. Each village, according to its siae, population and
fertility, was reclroned to contaiu so many hides. and when the land tax was
’ collected at its normal rate, each hide pald rs. so that Α ιο was collected from
every roo hides, and each oouuty vas usually so assassed that the total ior all
the villa contained in it worked out toa multiple of rroo hides. The
reclroning in hides then was esseutially artificial, and the hide had no fixed
area. None the less in apportioning the hides allotted ιο a village among the
estates aud holdings of which it was made up, the hide. as applied to arable
land, oi normal fertility. tended in practice to mean rro acres. Another
iactor also largely contributed to materie hides dissimilar, namely the
King’s habit ot arbitrarily lowering the original assessrnent oi particular
places to do s favour ιο their owuers, by dimiuishing the burden oi the land
tax. The favouritism thus shown to certain villages (usually to those
belonging to ecclmiasties) is remed, Beneficial hidation.
ln later times, ior example in the reign os Henry 111, the hides were
more frequently utilised sor assessing local rates and fines, than ior the King¹s
taxes· Here too we meet with favouritism‚ ior the obligation to contribule to
these rates (eg. for repair oi highways or bridges) or ιο common lines
was not universal. Sorae estates were lishle, others were exempt. This
