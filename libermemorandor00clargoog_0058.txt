ceedings. It is sound that John had on the moor twenty
beasts in excess ol his proper allowance.

At this point (p. 119) our good canon leaves his records ’
sor a while in order that he may tell a story about the
acquisition ol some land at Wiggenhall in Nort'olk, and
thence he digresses to the Barons’ War‚ the occupatiori os
ol the lsle ol Ely by the disinherited, King Henry's visit to
Cambridge, and so forth. But all this national history
seems to be parenthetic, and, so soon as the land is at peace,
we recor to Wiggenhall and observe the ill that besell John
the Chaplain who endeavoured to cheat the Prior. We
read oi proceedings in the ecclesiastical conns, but none of
the documents are transcribed. Ultimately John, as a
contumacious excommunicate, is arrested and imprisoned,
having been dragged by his seetlrom out the Franciscan's
church in Cambridge. Then a little more narrative carries
us on to the eyre held at Cambridge in 1272. This gives
occasion lor some brief notes of actions and final concords.
These we may pass by. Also we may pass by the incipient
dispute between the Canons and the Burgesses about the
right to drive cattle along the river bank from Midsummer
Common to Stourbridge Common (p. 133). That dispute
led to violent deeds during the Peasants' Rebellion in 13811.
We look sor something more deserving ol technical com-
ment.

Master of tlte Temple v. The Prior. Writ ol right ol'
advowson sor the chureh ol Waterbeach (pp. 135-6). The
Master counts on the seisin oi a predecessor in the time ol
Richard I. The Prior pleads that on a previous occasion
the Master brought a writ ol right, counting on a seisin in
the time ol Henry ll, and that because the seisin was laid
before the time os limitation (the coronation ol Richard Ι),
final judgment was given for the Prior. This plea prevails‚
and once more a final judgment is given sor the Prior.
All this matter appears to be copied irom the record.

The exact point ol the next two sections (ᾖ 5 5-6) is
not very plain. Apparently the Prior is charged at the
