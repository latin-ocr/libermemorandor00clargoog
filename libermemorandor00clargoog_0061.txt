doweress. This doweress is summoned to court by a quid
iuris clamat and attorns to the Prior. All this is t'rorn the
record. Then we learn that the Prior had to pay six marks
ior the release, but obtained this sum l’rom John oi Girton.

Maud wadum os Edward le cartm v. The Prior
(pp. 154—5). Writ ol’ entry lor a tenement in Bamwell,
dismissed sor want ol’ prosecution. The brief extract from
the roll is followed by a story which tells us why Maud
abandoned her action. For the understanding ol that story
it should be observed that a ‘part' ot' every fine which is
levied in the King's Court is preserved by the Court; itis
the ‘part’ known as the loot oi the fine. Thus, though
the Prior has not got in his possession the ‘part' ol a

land lies should there be given with the din it.

Roger Barbedor v. The Prior (pp. 156—7). Assize ol
mort d¹ancestor on the death os the plaintifi’s father sor land
in Hinxton. The Prior pleads that the ancestor did not
die seised in see, being but a tenant sor lile by the Prior’s
demise, and also that the plaintifi has an elder brother
living, namely, William. The plaintifi replies that William
cannot inherit as heis professed in religion. The jurors
tell a very curious story about William. He first became
a Carmelite lriar at Cambridge, and then became a Cister-
