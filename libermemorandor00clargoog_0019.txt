his chuckle at the escape ol the Prior's woodcutter‚ who

Prior having been careiul on behali oi himself and his

It will be hardly necessary to attempt asketch oi the
general history of Bamwell Priory, or even oi the archi· ·
tectural history oi the church and buildings, for Ι have
intentionally made the Chronological Summary so lull that
it will be easy to lind in it any event or series oi events
that may be required. On the other hand it is necessary
to state carefully my reasons ior placing the Priors as I
have done, ior our author’s besetting infirmity, a disregard
oi dates is responsible for a good deal os confusion with
regard to them.

No certain date occurs until we reach the account of
William os Devon, sixth Prior, srom whom we must first

work backwards, and then sorwards again. We read os him
that

be would have done much good in temporal as well as in spiritual
matters, ii the Lord had granted him a tranquil liie; but, during his
tenure oi office, the whole ol England and Wales was under a general

interdict...He died in the year oi our Lord 1213, and in the sixth year
ol the interdict ¹.

As this interdict began 23 March, 1208, part of the year
1213 would sall within the sixth year of its duration, as
stated above William os Devon was elected in the first
year oi the interdict, 1208, is I am right in taking “tempore
ejus '’ to mean his tenure ol office, and the whole sentence
to signify that the said tenure and the interdict began
together; and he died 25 May, 1213'.
