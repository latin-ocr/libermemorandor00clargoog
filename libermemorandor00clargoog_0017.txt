more ancient due known as ‘ward penny’ (pp. 238—272l
This is succeeded by a statement ol what was due for “view
os srankpledge” stom the vills in the various hundreds
(pp, 273-279); and this again by the amount ol Sheriff's
aid payable in each hundred (p. 280) The reason sor this
enumeration is set sorth in the prologue to the Sixth Book,
which is worth translating (p. 238):

ln several hundreds the Prior ol Bamwell has lands and tenements,
services and homages, customs and villeins; but, as the servants os the
Sherill often distrain of their own accord and unjustly, distraining
some whom they ought to pass over, and sparing others who ought ol
right to be distrained, in order to prevent the Prior or his tenants
being in the future oppressed unjustly by distraints ol this kind ior
suits in the courts ol the county or the hundred, Sheriff's aid or ward-
penny, it seemed uselul to write down in this little work the names ol
the hundreds, the tenants, and the tenements which ought to perlonn
services ol this sort, and have been in the habit ol performing them
from ancient days. And in future it will not be a man’s duty on
account os such distraint to go to the Castle to inspect the Sheriff’s
roll, but he may look into this book and gain his informatiom l'romit.

ln the Seventh Book we return to the Prior and
Conventus Barnwell, and we find that it contains a rull
list os all their tenants. Here again l will translate a
short passage from the prologue (p. 282) ε

As the Prior ol Bamwell has some lree tenants and some villeins,
who owe him services and customs, it appears useful to set down in
this little boolr the names ol all his tenants, their rents, their services,
the vill in which they live, their laws, and the places where they can
be distrained, according to what certain information can be discovered
about these matters at this time, namely, in the year ol ourLord1295,
and in the year since Simon de Ascellis became Prior the thirty
first.

The Eighth Book is wholly occupied witha Consue-
tudinarium, or Book ol Observances, of the Augustinian
Order. As this book has been already edited, with a
translation and notes, by the editor of this work¹, it has
been decided not to reprint it
