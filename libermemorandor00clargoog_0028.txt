Orchards and little crolts. Professor Maitland might
have added gardens to this enumeration; ior a glance at
the plans oi college sites given in Τ lre Architectural
Histary will shew how many gardens there were in what we
should now call the centre oi the town; and a similar
result will be attained by a study oi the large birds-eye
view os Cambridge made by John Hamond, and dated
1592. 1s there were still large tracts oi garden-ground at
that date, nearly 300 years aster the period we are now
considering, a fortiori there were such in 1279.

We will now suppose our visitor to leave the Great
Bridge, and to walk down Bridge Street, This street
was probably as crowded in the Middle Ages as at present,
perhaps more so. The town ol that day drawing its
supplies from the river, as l have already pointed out, aod
also from the neighbouring country, would be tull oi carts
and pack horsea When Loggan’s views were drawn this
was still the case; but in the thirteenth century, when the
townspeople were confined within the oval space between
the river and the King's Ditch‚ the unpaved streets (p. 227)
must have been filled to overflowing with carriages, carts,
horsea wayfarers, struggling as best they could through the
mud and din, ior scavengers did not exist in those days.
Our strangcr would presently pass, on his left, the Church
of S. Clement‚ with, probably, not many houses on each side
ol it On his right the houses would be more numerous,
because more convenient. Behind thern was the river-
the highway-to which each could have private access.
When he reached the Norman Church os S. Sepulchre,
or Round Church, where two streets meet, he would
naturally turn down High Street, sor if he selected 'the
other, he would soon reach the outskirts of the town, close
to the present Post Office.

On his lest, as he turned into High Street, was the

Jewry‚ often alluded to in the Memoranda. l do not know
how iar it extended, but the church os All Saints there
situated, is always called Ecclesia Omnium Sanctarum in
J udaismo, or, All Halowes in thesram, to distinguish it srom
