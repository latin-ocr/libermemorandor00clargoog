the stone cross which was on the eastern side ol the
Huntingdon Road opposite the point where it is joined by
the road now known as Pleasant Row‚ anciently Hare
Hill.’' ’

Mr Gray then discusses the position os the other points
mentioned in the above passage, but, as l have determined
to avoid details as sar as possible in this Introduction,
l will merely say that, aiter pointing out that the jurors,
being local men, could not have made a mistake in pure
ignorance, he argues that the vetus fossatum which crossed
Bridge Street opposite to the site now occupied by
Magdalene College, was once a navigable stream; and
in support os this view he cites a further passage from the
Memoranda (p. 99) giving the evidence os a very aged
palmer-pilgrim “who said that he had seen ships (naves)
corne 'almost up to the door os S. Giles’ church.'’

On leaving the castle and descending the hill our visitor
would see on his right the little church ol' S. Peter, and on
his left, in the angle between the road along which he was
walking, and a track which led eastwards to Chesterton,
the somewhat larger church os S. Giles. This is the
church built by Pycot and his wile in 1092, adjoining which
was the first house for their Canons (pp. 39, 46) in which
they resided until Pain Peverel gave thern “thirteen acres
in the fields os Cambridge round the springs oi Bamwell''
(p. 43). The ground between this church and the river
was claimed by the Prior in 1286 as the gift os Countess
Matilda to his convent (p. 168)

From this point where iour ways meet-the Carlax
oi Cambridge-a very short space oi street leads down to
the river at the point where the Great Bridge now stands.
ln the thirteenth century the ancient iord had been
replaced by a bridge, of course oi wood; and in 1279 the
commissioners of Edward l found that it was “so broken
and dislocated that the carriages oi noble persons and
others sall into the water in such a way that both men and
horses come to the surlace with difficulty¹.''
