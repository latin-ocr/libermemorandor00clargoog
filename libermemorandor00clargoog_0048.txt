xliv Introduction

delensive weapons. lt is characterized by the unusually
large number os ‘ records ’ (that word being used in a specific
sense) which it contains But still our scribe is not com-
posing a cartulary, or a mere collection oi those entries upon
judicial rolls which relate the law-suits os his house. He
adopts a narrative form. He will tell us briefly the story
os the priory, laying stress on litigation and introducing the
very words oi those iormal enrolments to which reference
should be made hereaiter is anyone is rash enough to call
in question the rights os St Giles os Bamwell We must
add, however, that when he comes down to his own time he
begins to sprinkle his story with anecdotos which he tells in
a spirited and humorous way. These will to modern eyes
be the most attractive portion oi his work. Nevertheless,
ii we look at them closely we shall see that as a general
rule these little tales are put in writing lor the same reason
that has dictated the transcription oi the legal ‘records'
They are meant to be instmctive. They are meant to
suggest what should be done hereaiter if litigation is
imminent; but happily the writer sometimes, ii l may so
say, ‘sees the iun os the thing’ aud gives us in miniature
some pictures oi men and manners ior which we ought
to be grateful.

We have thus a very curious mixture. We have
‘records’ that are set forth in the highly formal and
technical language of the lawyers ol the thirteenth century,
and then we have anecdotes which are told in an unusually
colloquial kind of Latin. The second oi these two elements
in the eompound will be easily understood by all who have
pald any attention to English medieval history. Oi the
first l have been asked by my friend Mr Clark to say a lew
words, '

The ⁴ records' ol which Ι speak are transcripts oi entries
made upon judicial rolls: upon the rolls oi the central
courts at Westminster; upon rolls os the justices who are
commissioned to hear those actions that are known as
‘assizes'; and upon the rolls oi the justices in eyre. Such
transcripte lrom judicial rolls are occasionally to be found
