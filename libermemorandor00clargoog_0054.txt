Kenilworth and Barnwell¹. '

We come to a well known dispute between the Priory
and the University(p. 95). The Chancellor brings‘an action
01 annuity ’ against the Prior, and the Prior has to give way.
The question is settled by a ‘line' levied before the justices
in eyre· at Cambridge. Fines, 11 they are at all long-and
this one is somewhat long—are not very easy instruments
to read. Therelore the hint may be permissible that the
‘Haec est finalis concordia inter A. et B! must sooner or

Henry III had begun rigorously to insist that his tenants
by serjeanty-who in the past have been, at least in name,
his menial servants—were not to alienate their holdings.
When an alienation had occurred, he held that in strictness
a forfeiture had been committed, and, by way 01 grace, he
