afterwards passed to S. John's College with its other
possessions3 and the line Norman dwelling-house which
bears the absurd nameus School os Pythagoras-part

founder took the precaution oi buying in case they should
prefer Cambridge to Oxsord as a permanent place for
study¹.

Before we leave the Great Bridge let us consider ior
a moment the very interesting question os the number
ol houses which the town contained in the thirteenth
century3 and especially the number to be assigned to the
district which we have just left, and which in the
Memoranda (p. 282) is styled “Beyond Bridge (Ultra
pontem).”

Domesday Book tells us that Grentebrige contained
400 houses divided into ten wards; that of those 400 houses
27 had been destroyed to make room for the castle; and
that two oi the ten wards had been thrown together. lt
has usually been the custom to assume that all these

houses and wards were transpontine3 but this view has
been contested by Professor Maitland¹, who has made
a caresul analysis os the Cambridge ol the Hundred Rolls,
and shews thatin 1279 the whole town had only about 5 50

houses, os which not more than 72 were allotted to the three
transpontine parishes os S. Giles‚ S. Peter, and All Saints.
He states his view in the following brilliant passage:

l see the Grentebrige oi the Confessor’s day as a very sparse
group oi houses l should not be surprised ii it already reached as
iar south as the King's Ditch oi later days, and ii only two or three oi
its ten wards were transpontine. At this time a vill or 40 houses was
rather large than small. Cambridge had 400. Take the house-
bedecked nucleus oi an ordinary village and magnisy it ten-iold; it
will cover a good space oi ground. l would not suggest that the
nucleus ol a borough was as loosely compacted as was the nucleus oi
a common vill; but we must leave much room for what we should call
farm buildings, ior orchards and little croits⁸.
