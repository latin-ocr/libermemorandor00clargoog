small bridge, and thence by a larger bridge into the fields
beyond. Here was Henny or Heneye (p. 289) a ¹mysterious

name which l cannot explain ; but the locality was thought
important enough to have a lane all to itsell. Milne Street,
which we will suppose our stranger to follow, led, as its
name imports, to the Mills, namely the Kings’ Mill and the
Bishop’s Mill on Coe Fen. lt must therefore have been
a busy, and at times a crowded, thoroughfare. lt contained
the church of S. John Baptist. often mentioned in the
Memoranda, and the House ol the Carmelites (p. 211).
Between the church and the friary were three lanes, Water

(p. 287) as situated in it. ln those days Peas Hill
was connected with the Market Place proper by a short
street, the west side of which consisted of houses abutting
against the east end of S. Edward’s Church. The Market
Place proper, an t-shaped area, “contained all the principal
buildings, the Cross, the Tolbooth or Guildhall, the prison,
