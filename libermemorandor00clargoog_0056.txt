lii Introduction

There is no law-suit here. We have an inquest taken
ex officio sor the ascertainment oi royal rights.

The Prior v. Richard dr Capella and Tre Prior v.
Humphrey de Cloptone and others (pp. 106-8). Two assizes
of novel disseisin. The first is taken upon the delault os
the defendant; the jurors lind a disseisin and the Prior
recovers. In the second the defendants consess the dis·
seisin and the Prior recovers In addition to the record

ol these two assues, we have the two original writs and
also the ‘patent os assize’ appointing justices to take
these two assizes. The record begins with the formula,
Assysa uenit recognitum (p. 107).

Ralph de Camoys and wife v. Thr Prior and Otho son os
William (pp. 108—110l. Assize os darein presentment
conceming the church ol Burton. The plaintiil' says that
the last parson was presented by his great-great-grand-
mother. The Prior says that a predecessor oi his was
the presentor. Otho says that his grandmother was the
presentor. The jurors of the assize find for the Prior. He
has judgment and a writ to the bishop. All this matter

seems to be transcribed irom the record. Then a writ is
also transcribed; it is the dotringas iuratores (p. 110). ⁰

This assize, like other assizes oi darein presentment, is
taken before the Bench at Westminster, and not before
justices of assiae.

lt next appears that, despite this victory in a purely
possessory aetion, the Prior and his presentee had to make
peace with Ralph de Camoys and his wile, promising them
twenty marks in return ior a release oi any right they
might have in the advowson. This transaction was effected
before justices in eyre at Lincoln. The account oi¹ it
(pp. 110—1) seems to come irom the rolls os those

justices.
