recorded after the manner of a Register. On the contrary,
matters of the most¹ varied nature and interest are set down
as they carne to hand, without any attempt at chrono-
logical order. This practice of our author causes
considerable difficulty to those who are in search of a
particular document, or who wish to extract from his pages

the whole work a table of contents, but it is merely a list
of the rubrics to the chapters, and gives no dates. Ι have

the mist of legal technicalities, and to set forth its relation
to the history of the Priory or to the law of the kingdom, in
language which all can understand.

The F irst Book opens with an account of the foundation
