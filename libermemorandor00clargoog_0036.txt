The eastern fields‚ commonly known as the Bamwell
Fields, were four in number, and, counting frorn the south
west, appear in the following order (see plan)¹:

1. Ford F ield, so called from the ford by which the
London Road entered the territory of Cambridge, lay
between the Trumpington Road and the Hills Road, but
was bounded on the townward side by what is now
Lensfield Road.

2. Middle Field lay between the Hills Road and the
line of the Mill Road, but was bounde'd on the townward
side by what is now Parker's Piece.

3. Bradmore or Bradmoor F ield, called also Meledich,
lay between the Mill Road and the Newmarket Road; but
the townward part of it was known as the Clayangles
or Clayhanger.

4 Sturbridge F ield, anciently called Estenhale, lay on
both sides of the Newmarket Road just beyond llarnwell
Priory.

Professor Maitland has obtained evidence which makes
it clear that in Ford F ield the site of Peterhouse and the
tract subsequently called Swine Croft or St Thomas’ leys
were once arable; that in Middle F ield, Parker’s Piece was
arable ; and that in Bradmoor Field, Christ’s Piece also
was arable. The tract therefore which extended from Coe
Fen to the Newmarket Road was in very ancient times one
large cornfield. Subsequently part of these fields was
laid down as grass, and then the word ‘ley' instead of the
word ‘selion’ was used with reference to them. Some of
the old selions may be detected to this day in the grounds
of Downing colleget Ι

On the west side of Cambridge there were also four
fields, but, as our Memoranda do not busy themselves with
thern, l need not do more than mention them in a summary

lashion.
