clustered round it¹.’' Adjoining the Market Place our visitor
would see the church ol S. Mary the Great‚ with houses
built up against it, and no open space in iront ol it; but it
must be remembered that that church was very different in
the thirteenth century srom the stately building os the

present day, which was not begun till near the end os the
fifteenth century. Ι

To leave the Market Place nur visitor could choose
between Shoemaker Row, now Market Street, and Petty
Cury, which keeps its curious old name, over the meaning
os which so much discussion has arisen. In the period
which I am trying to describe it must have been a singularly
pictoresque street, lull ol movement, soron the south side ol
it there were at least three well-known inns, the Lion, the
Falcon, and the Wrestlers; to take the order in which they
would be approached from the Market Place. At the end
of Petty Cury our visitor would find himself at the south·
east comer of the town; and, is he turned slightly to the
right, as laras Barnwell Gate, then probably a real gate, he
would catch a glimpse ol the cultivated fields stretching
away as iar as the eye could see, and in the loreground the
parish ehurch ol S. Andrew, with the Dominican Friary
beyond. From this point he would turn to the left, and
walk up Bridge Street. Passing on the leit Trinity Church,
then a very small building, he would soon reach the
Franciscan House at the corner os S. Rhadegund's Lane.
Turning into this lane, and crossing the bridge over the
King’s Ditch, he would see on his lest the boundary walls
os the nunnery oi S. Rhadegund founded 1133. After
passing this, as he pursued his way to Barnwell Priory, he
would have on his leit the Green Crost, an open space
ol pasture, on part oi which, nearest to the Causeway, the
Fair called Midsummer Fair was held (p. 87 note), and on
his right Bradmoor F ield, part of the arable field. At the
Priory, round which there was a small suburb, he would
lind that the Canons did not forget to entertain strangers¹.
