lviii Introduction

cian monk at Vaudey. Then, however, a certain woman,
asserting that before his profession he had contracted
marriage with her, sued him before the ordinary and de-
· raigned (disrocronaoit) him as her husband. So he is cap·
’ able of inheriting, and the plaintiii is therefore not next
heir. The jurors also find that the Prior is right in his
other contention‚ and that the plaintiif's father held only
for life. So the Prior has judgment.

Thr Prior v. Henry T uylrt (pp. 150-8). Asslze of
novel disseisin for a house in Cambridge The alleged
disseisin consists in the tenant having blocked up a door·
way so that his landlord‚ the Prior, cannot enter to distrain
for rent arrear. The jurors find a verdict for the defendant,
and he has judgment. However the Prior threatens an
‘attaint,' and the defendant yields. The record of the
assize is given at length. An ‘attaint' was a proceeding in
which the twelve jurors might be convicted of having swom
falsely by a verdict of twenty-four other jurors, and the
‘attainted ’ jurors would be severely punished.

Τ lu Prior v. John Humfrey ond cecilia iris wife (pp. 159
-160). Writ of customs and services. The extract from
a roll (ᾗ 84) shows that the tenants make default in appear·
ance and that the sheriff is directed to distrain them. We
are then told that Cecilia, who was holding the tenement in
her own right, came with her husband into the borough
court at Cambridge and released all her right to the Prior,
but as no fine was levied, there may be reason to fear that
hereafter she may renew her claim; so cantion is desirable.

Tro Prior v. Hugh de Rus and another (pp. 160-2)
Assize of novel disseisin for a rent lssuing from a horse mill.
A verdict favourable to the Prior is given, but the excerpt
from the roll does not show any judgment

Walter otte Dolo v. Tro Prior (p. 162). An action for
land in Barton: apparently an action of cosinage No
record is given. The Prior being prepared to' prove that
the demandant’s father was hanged as a selon, the deman-
dant withdraws from his writ. Descent could not be traced
through a felon.
