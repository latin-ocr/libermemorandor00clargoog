what that name might imply‚’ but that it was originally a
nich-name, well or ill deserved, we can hardly'doubt.
The modern English form ol the name would probably be
Peacltq.

The next record that we meet with comes srom the
rolls ol justices in eyre who visited Cambridge in 1299
(p. 63)¹. The Prior is to answer to the King quo waranto
he claims certain ‘franchises ’-that is, royal rights—to wit,
view oi irankpledge and the amends for breaches os the
assize ol bread and beer in Chesterton andan annual sair
in Barnwell. He escapes easily, producing royal charters.
He is told that he may ‘go without day '—that ἰε, he need
not come into Court again. But, as is usual in such cases,
there isa salvo ior the King’s right: in other words, the
King will not de estopped by this record from hereaiter
urging any right that he may have to recover these
franchises.

When he is compiling his Second Book the writer looks
outside the ‘domus' but thinks primarily os property that
lies close at hand. Specially he has to speak os Chesterton.
Now Chesterton was part oi the ancient demesne oi the
Crown. We begin withan extract from Domesday Book
which describes itas domim'ca villa Regis (p. 75). This
handsonre manor passed into the hands os the Prior and
Canons. King John had granted thern an annuity ol ten
pounds by way ol alms. Theo, instead oi the annuity, he
granted them the vill os Chesterton ior ever, reserving a
rent os ἦ 30 os blanched money, which are equivalent to

ᾖ 31 by tale. Confirmations were obtained from Henry 111
and Edward Ι.

He King had a right to impose upon the manors oi
his ancient demesne the kind os tax that was known asa
tallage. lt he allowed one ol those rnanors to go out os
his own hand by putting a mesne lord over it, normally he
lost his right. Thencelorth it was ior that lord to impose
ior his own profit a tallage on that manor when the King
was tallaging the manors that were still in his own hand.
