whole work in its complete form, for he was keenly in-
terested in it, not merely for the legal cases, but even more
for the minute records in the Sixth and Seventh Books‚
where the villages in Cambridgeshire 3ηά Huntingdonshire
(in part) are enumerated, with the duties which each holder
of land was bound to perform, and the payments he was
bound to make. ’

ln the next place Ι wish to return my very cordial thanks
to my friend, W. J. Corbett, Μ.Α., Fellow of King's College,
who supplied me with the English names of the places
mentioned in the Sixth Book, 3ηά also corrected the Index,
3ηά gave me much assistance in drawing up the Glossary.
l was anxious to make this latter as full as possible,
especially in legal terms, the significance of which can only
be properly expressed by one who is both an antiquary and
a lawyer-a combination which l have had the good fortune
to discover in Mr Corbett. Further, before l leave the
Glossary, Ι wish to thank Professor Skeat for assistance
for which Ι cannot be sufficiently grateful.

Ι have also to thank G. J. Tumer, Esq, Barrister at law,
for many references to the Rolls of Assize and other public
documents; Artbur Gray, MA, Fellow and Tutor of Jesus
College, for information respecting the River Cam and the
Castle; M. R. James, Litt.D., Provost of King's College,
3ηά C. E. Sayle, Μ.Α., οΙ St John’s College, for help and
encouragement on many occasions.
