‘arrented the serjeanty,' that is, he substituted a new money
rent sor the old, and often obsolete‚ personal service.
The Priory has acquired 121 acres at Comberton from a
man who in theory ought to have been baking the king's
breed. However, the king is merciful and content to take
the light rent of a half-mark.

Turning to the Third Book we find ourselves looking
beyond Cambridge and Chesterton and the Priory's home
farm, and we come upon a rich mixture of records and
anecdotes. Let us briefly notice with their technical

narngei the various lawsuits in which the Priory is con·
cern .

Mabael wrilow os Geoffrey de Howcs v. The Prior
(pp. 100-3). Action of dower unde nihil habet for land at
Madingley, before justices in eyre at Cambridge and
thence adjourned to Lewes‚ and to Wilton. The Prior
pleads that Geoffrey held for his life only. Mabel replies
that he was seised in fee. The issue is tried before the
sheriff by a jury which gives a verdict for the Prior. This
verdict being returned to the justices, they give judgment
for the Prior. Besides extracts from the ‘record' of this
· action, the memorialist gives us in full the ‘original' writ,
that is, the writ by which the action was begun (p. τοι),
and the writ of inquest directed by the justices in eyre to
the sheriff (p. 103). These writs would not appear at full
length upon the enrolled ‘record'

erliam de Bloy v. The Prior. Assize of novel disseisin
before justices in eyre at Hereford. The assiae finds a
verdict for the Prior, and the Prior has judgment (p. 104)
ln this instance the record is not set before ns in cremo,
but apparently a copy of it was lying before the maker of
this book, and from that copy he takes some phrases

lnquest of office taken by the escheator as to the
tenure of land at Madingleyfp.105). Α suggestion has
been rnade to the King that the Prior is his tenant in chief
of half a knight's fee, also that one Robert Morel demised
this land to the Prior for a term of years that has expired.
As to both questions a verdict is found for the Prior.
