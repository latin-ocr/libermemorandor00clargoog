He died, an old man, “in the thirty-eighth year 01 his
office¹.'' His death may therefore be placed in 1251.
Henry 01 Eye, tenth Prior, “in his third year 01 office
placed his resignation in the hands 01 the official 01 the see
01 Canterbury, during a vacancy 01 the see 01 Ely¹.'’ The
vacancy here mentioned must be that which occurred aster
the death 01 Hugh Northwold,6 August, 1254, whose
successor, William 01 Kilkenny‚ though elected, according

·' to Bentham, “about the middle 01 October, 12 54⁸,'’ was not

consecrated until 15 August, 1255. The see was therefore
without a Bishop sor a full year, and the Prior's resignation
may have taken place either at the end 01 1254 01 the
beginning 01 1255.

The successor to Henry 01 Eye, Jolan 01 Thorley,
eleventh Prior, “in the eleventh year of his tenure 01 office
as Prior, resigned it into the hands 01 the Bishop 01 Ely⁴.”
Accordingly he was Prior 110111 1254 01 1255 10 1265 01
1266; Ι111111 0111 chronology would be perlectly simple 11 we
had no other evidence than this to deal with. But, among
the vexations which ruined his health was the outrage at
Wiggenhall; and the rubric 01 the chapter in which that
event is recorded (p.119) runs as follows: Dc preducibus
de Wygenltale anno regni regis H. .lij0.; that is to say it
is placed between 28 October, 1267, and 27 October, 1268,
01 a year too late.

Further, his successor Simon de Ascellis, who ought
perhaps to be called Simon 01 Ashley, twelsth Prior,
resigned 24 June, 1297⁸‚ having been Prior “ 101 thirty years
and more (per triginta annos et amplius),'' a length 01 office
which places his accession in 1267, or in 1266, according to
the sense we assign to the words etamplius. 1 am inclined
to think that the simplest way out 01 the difficulty is to
suppose that a wrong date has been inserted into the rubric
quoted above; and that 101 .lij0 we should read ‚lje-an
