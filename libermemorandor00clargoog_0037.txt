1. Grithow (Gravel Hill) Field, lay between the roads
to Huntingdon and St Neots‚

2. Middle Field lay next to this, on the south side ol
the road to St Neots‚ extending as far as Bin Brook.

3. Little Field lay next to this, extending as lar as
the road to St Neots‚ but separated from Middle Field by
a l'ootpath known as the Barton way, which led across the
fields to the village of Barton. Portfield seems to have
been part of Little F ield ¹.

4 Carme F ield, the most southern os the sour, took its
name lrorn a block ol twenty selions in Newnham‚ known
in the sourteenth century as the Carmedole’.

Professor Maitland points out that “there was little
meadow in medieval Cambridge‚” and quotes William
Harrison‚ writing in 1577, who says:

lt hath no such stote ol' medone grounde as may suffice ior the
ordinarie expences ol the towne and Vniuersitie‚ wherefore they are
interced...to provide their haye from other villages about, which
minister the sante unto them in verye great abundancet.

There was Long Green, which lay along the let't bank
ol the Cam, from the Mill Pool to the Great Bridge;
Sheeps Green; Coe Fen, or part ol it; and Green Crolt.
Between these two latter were Swine Croft, Parkers Piece,
and Christ's Piece, but these were late additions. Parker's
Piece, lor instance, was not turned ‘from tillage into sward'

until alter it was acquired by the town from Trinity College
in 1613.
