xlviii Introduction

However, it appears that King John, aster his grant to the
Priory, twice succeeded in tallaging the men ol Chesterton.
On a third occasion they were spared, the deed of grant
being taken as an answer to the claim. At this point we
have extracts from the Pipe Rolls which contain the accounts
rendered by the sherifls at the Exchequer (p. 78). Theo
,in 1241 the Prior succeeds in getting srom the King's
Council an admission that, despite those two unlucky prece-
dents, which, it is observed, occurred in the time os the
great Interdict‚ it is not ior the King to tallage the Prior’s
men in Chesterton. Then we leam from a well told story
how at a later day the King's escheator, himself a man oi
religion, repeated theold claim, but was sul} willing to take
a bribe, which bribe, however, he did not get, since the
Prior obtained a writ from the Exchequer commanding
him to desist. We observe in passing that the men oi
Chesterton are not the gainers by the Prior's victory. He
proceeds to tallage them ‘sor his own proper use'
(ro 78-82l·

We continue our study oi the rent payable in respect of
Chesterton. The King granted a part oi it, namely ἕζεο,
to one William de Hastingtot, to be received by him irom
the Prior’s hand. lt was a grant that was to endure only
until the King should give William an equivalent amount
oi land, to wit, twenty librates. William died leaving an
infant heir, and the King proceeded to act as though he, as
guardian in chivalry, could deal with this rent oi 520
during the heir's minority. He granted it to one Roget de
Wauton. Then, however, William's widow asserted that
she was entitled to part oi it as doweress and to the residue
as the heir’s guardian in socage. Her claim was successful,
and the Prior was ordered to pay the 520 to her. These
dealings with the rent are os interest to the Priory, for it is
of importanee that payments be made only to those who

can give a good discharge. It will be seen that at one point
the Prior paid to Roger de Wauton ‚54 ros. which should
have been pald into the Exchequer, but succeeded in

getting the mistake set right (pp. 84-5). Then, the
