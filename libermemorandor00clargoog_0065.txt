might have been very interesting. Seemingly the Univer-
sity had no other base forits claim than its own ‘statutes
and customs.’

Alan de Frestone v. T lu Prior (pp. 18 5-7). Action in
the Court ol Common Pleas sor the arreers ot' an annuity
granted by deod to endure ior so long as the plaintifl'
should serve the Priory as its advocate. The Prior pleads
that the plaintiff has refused his services and a specific
instance os such refusal is alleged. ln reply the plaintiff
denies the refusal. The Prior joins issue (et Prior
similr'ter); and a uenire facias lor jurors is awarded. The
sections (ᾖ 121—2) taken from the record should be read
before the writ (5 120) which is the uenire focr'rrs issued
alter tbe joinder os issue We are then told that the Prior
thought it well to make peace at the eost os ,g 12. A
passage, which may at first sight seem obscure, is to be
explained as follows: the clerks of the court have an

interest in the success os a plaintiff, because they are
establishing a customary right to take a considerable share

out of the Prior’s 2512 go to them.

A writ and a short extract from a roll (pp. 185-6) shew
us the Prior acquitted by a jury in an action oi conspiracy
brought by one John Lewyn; but wherein the alleged
conspiracy consisted we do not see.

The Third Book ends with a writ declaring that the
menos Chesterton, which, as already said, is part ol’ the
ancient demesne ol the Crown, need not contribute when,
as happens from time to time, an amercement is imposed
upon the county os Cambridge (pp. 188—9). As a counter-
poise lor their liability to tallage‚ the men ol the ancient
demesne enjoy this immunity from ‘common amercements!

The Fourth Book contains but little that relates to liti·
gation in the temporal courts. lt is filled chiefly with
events that take place between the years 1290 and 1296.
‘The taxation ol Pope Nicholas’ in 1291 seems to have
suggested the retrospect ol earlier ‘taxations' with which
the Book begins. Various letters os proxy are then inserted;
