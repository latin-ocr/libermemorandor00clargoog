is given us, and the verdict of an inquestss ιιι), and we
are told that judgment went against the Prior. Apparently
the Prior based his claim to immunity on the mere fact
that he had not contributed in the past; but we see no
pleadings. Less than we might wish has yet been done to
make available for modern students the valuable materials
that are contained on the plea rolls of the Exchequer.
The story that lies before us is typical of a great mass of
quarrels over the incidence of local imposts.

The Prior v. W illiam sonos Robert and others (p. 179).
The men of Madingley, bent on distraining the Prior for
his contribution, made the mistake of taking his beasts of
the plough. Consequently he brings against them the
action given by the Statute de Districtione Scaccarii

University (pp. 182—4). Assize of novel disseisin. The
parties plead to issue. An order is given that the assize be
taken (tileo capiatur assisa), but before the recognitors corne
to give a verdict, the parties make peace The record is
set forth at length. The dispute arises out of the strange

lodgings at a taxed rate. A verdict about this matter
