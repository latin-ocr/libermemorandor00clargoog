xiv Introductrhn

Belore l pass to other matters l should like to say a
few words on the author os the Memoranda. He gives no
hint as to who he was, but itis obvious that he must have
been at least a canon ol the House, and probably one who
held some high office, lor in no other way could he have
had access to the documents and private, matters with
which he deals. Itis probable that he based his work
on that of a previous historian; lor, when he is telling the
story ol Prior Domesman's generosity in giving his father's
land to the House (p. 98), he says: “so wrote Canon
Guarinus,'’ but he evidently has doubts about his accuracy,
lor he adds: “I do not remember to have seen the deod ol
gist.'' That he examined originals is obvious from the
way in which he notes minute particulars—as the colour
ol the wax ol which a Royal Seal was made, and its
condition. lle may have been a student in the
neighbouring University, sor he was evidently a learned
person, who wrote a good style, and was well acquainted
with classical Latin. Whoever he was, the epithets which

he applies to Prior Gerard (p. 64), when he calls him
pleasant, and very good humoured omnm et hyllan's
valde), might have been applied with justice to himself.
There is, ol course, what l may call a professional tone
about a good deal os his narrative ; the world is very evil ;
the monastic orders arethe objects ol a cruel persecution;
the hand ol' every man is against them3 and almost any

weapon may justiliably be used by them to combat their
enemies. But, when allowance has been made lor the
introduction os these unavoidable phrases, how even is
the flow ol his narrative; how admirably he describes
an event; what 'humorous touches he introduces when·
occasion allows os it. ln support ol what Ι have said let
me cite his description os the burning of the choreb-tower
(p. 220); his account ol what befell at Wiggenhall, when
Prior Jolan and some of his canons were set upon by
thieves, and barely escaped with their lives (pp. 119—121);
· the evident amusement with which he tells the story of the
worn-out horse sent as a present to a great man (p. 126);
