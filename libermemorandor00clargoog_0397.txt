in this duty, it will be amerced. If on the other hand he was in a tithing.
the ameroement will fall on the tithing. The meintenanoe of the system was
errfomed by periodioai inspections or what might be called “field days ” of the
pledges. Twice a year the sheriff held in each hundred a speciaily full ⁸

, hundred-count, to see that all men who ought to be are in frank pledge.
This was called view of franlr pledge (visas franci plegii). 'ihc strict theory
of the law seems to have required that all the franlr pledges should attend the
view; but, as a matter of lact. it was usual for none but the chief pledges to
attend; often however they had to bring with thern asum of money which
was accepted in lieu oi the productior of their tithings. The arnonnt
contributed on these occasions by the hundreda of Cambridgeshire and
Huntingdonshire is given in the Memoranda, pp. arg-279. These sums
probably formed a fund out of which the amercernents above mentioned could
be discharged. Over a large part of England the persons subject to the law
of franla pledge were distributed into grows, each consisting of ten persons;
each group was known aa a tithing; each was presided over by one of the
associated persons who was known as the chief pledge, tithing-rnan. reeve,
etc Hr'st. Ε. Lacu, i. 568-571. Ι have employed the words of the
authors so far as was possible.

lt may be added that in sorae of the south-western counties the tithing

was not a persona} group of ten men, buta territorial subdivision of the vill,
the inhabitants of each tenitoriai'tithing forming a separate franlr pledge
